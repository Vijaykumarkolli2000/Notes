Azure:
====================

Pipeline:--> pipeline is logical grouping of activities that together perform a task.
	eg: pipeline can have set of activities that take data from ADLS and perform some transfomation of data using U-SQL and load data into SQL DB.

Activity:--> Activities in a pipeline defines actions to perform on data.
	eg: copy a data from one location of blob storage and load in to anther location of blob storage.
Type of activities:
1) Data Movement Activities: -> move data from one to anther location
2) Data transfomation Activities: -> Sort the data like 10cl to 4cl, and transform data one to anther locality.
3) Data Control Flow Activities: -> flow of data, like if else statement in pipeline environment.

Linked Service and Data Sets: 
	Linked service are used to connect Other resources with Azure Data Factory.
	Linked services are like connection strings for resources to connect.

	DataSets are simply points or references the data, which you want to use in your activities as input or output.

Triggers in Azure Data Factory: -> 
	# Triggers - You can execute your pipeline.
	# Triggers determines when a pipeline execution needs to be kicked off.
	# Triggers and Pipelines have a ManyToMany relationship(except for the tumbling window trigger).
	# Multiple triggers kickoff only one pipeline and vice versa.
Types of triggers:
	1) schedule Trigger: -> A trigger that invokes a pipeline on wall clock schedule.
	2) Tumbling window trigger: -> a trigger that operates on periodic intervals, while also rataining state.
	3) Event-Based-trigger: -> A trigger that responds to an event.



Azure virtual machines:
	In corporate data centers, applications are diployed to physical server.
	Deployed -> rent virtual server, virtual machines(virtual server in Azure), Azure virtual machines(provision and manage virtual machines).







chmod 400 my-first-vm_key.pem
ssh -i YOUR_KEY_PATH azureuser@PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS
ssh -i my-first-vm_key.pem azureuser@13.90.35.80
 
apt-get -y update
apt-get -y install nginx
 
echo "Hello World"
echo "Hello World" > /var/www/html/index.html
echo "Hello World from in28minutes" > /var/www/html/index.html
 
hostname
echo "$(hostname)"
echo "Hello World from $(hostname)"
echo "Hello World from $(hostname)" > /var/www/html/index.html

$hostname -i --> gives Ip address


Key Changes

You do not need an SSH key anymore

Instead of python --version you can use python3 --version


sudo su --> execute commands as root user
apt-get -y update -->update package index
apt-get -y install nginx --> install nginx and start web server.\
echo "Welcome to in28minutes $(hostname)" > /var/www/html/index.html


mysql --host=mysql-server-in28minutes.mysql.database.azure.com --user=mysqlserver -p
 
create database todos;
use todos;
create table user (id integer, username varchar(30) );
describe user;
insert into user values (1, 'Ranjith');
insert into user values (2, 'Ramesh');
select * from user;
